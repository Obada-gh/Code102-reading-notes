# HTML & CSS, Chapter 17
HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find it easier to understand how they can be used now that you have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These new elements are going to play an important part in creating layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:

* The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
* How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
* How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements

## TRADITIONAL HTML LAYOUTS
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
