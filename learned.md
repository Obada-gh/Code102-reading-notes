## markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

for me i used the markdown in gethub site you can say its a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, 
adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in,
like # or *.you can use this pdf file for the [markdown syntaxs](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf):sparkles:

## git:

First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions. It can be used completely exclusive of any cloud-hosting service — you don’t even need internet access, except to download it. 

Compared to other version control systems, Git is responsive, easy to use, and inexpensive (free, actually). Git is also specially designed to work well with text files — which, if you think about it, is what code actually is. But one thing that really sets Git apart is its branching model. Branching allows you to create independent local branches in your code. This means you can try out new ideas, set aside branches for production work, jump back to earlier branches, and easily delete, merge, and recall branches at the click of a button.

## git vs github:
This photo shows the comparision between git and githup ![git vs github](https://blog.devmountain.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Gitvs_Github-1a-1.jpg?width=600&name=Gitvs_Github-1a-1.jpg).

So, taken all together: Git vs. GitHub… what’s the difference? Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

what we you see in the photo its the tirmanl or the [cmd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBWVgE0ewk) what we want to talk about is a command you can use it in the cmd
called git_acp Command for adding files, make a commit and push the current branch.           

git_acp is an Ansible module for git add, git commit, git push and git config operations on local or remote (https/ssh) git repo.
